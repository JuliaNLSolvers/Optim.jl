# Optim (unversioned) release notes
* The line search functionality has been separated into a new package
  [LineSearches.jl](https://github.com/anriseth/LineSearches.jl), see
  [277](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl/pull/277).
* Make move to minimizer (the argmin) and minimum (objective at argmin) final: field names are now in sync with function based API.

# Optim v0.6.1 release notes
