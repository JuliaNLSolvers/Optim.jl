# Optim (unversioned) release notes
* Newton and BFGS: set initial step length to one.
See [328](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl/pull/328).

# Optim v0.7.3 release notes
* OptimizationOptions is now unexported, and has been renamed to Options. Must be accessed as Optim.Options as a result.
* Bug fixes to Nelder-Mead tracing.
* Keywords with ! in them have been deprecated to version without. For example, linesearch! -> linesearch.
* Failures in a line search now terminates the optimization with a warning and status of non-convergence. The results can still be accessed, but `minimizer(res)` will not represent a local minimum.
  See [275](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl/pull/275).

# Optim v0.7.0 release notes
* Refactor code internally to clean up code and allow more flexible use Optim
* Switch to new (v.0.3) ForwardDiff
* Make minimizer/minimum transition final
* Fix dispatch bug for univariate optimization.
* The line search functionality has been separated into a new package
  [LineSearches.jl](https://github.com/anriseth/LineSearches.jl), see
  [277](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Optim.jl/pull/277).
* Make move to minimizer (the argmin) and minimum (objective at argmin) final: field names are now in sync with function based API.

# Optim v0.6.1 release notes
* Assess convergence in *g* before iterating to avoid line search errors if `initial_x` is a stationary point
* Fix trace bug in LevenbergMarquardt.
* Add ForwardDiff AD functionality to NewtonTrustRegion
* Make documentation even more noticable in README.md
