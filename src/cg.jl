# Conjugate gradient
#
# This is an independent implementation of:
#   W. W. Hager and H. Zhang (2006) Algorithm 851: CG_DESCENT, a
#     conjugate gradient method with guaranteed descent. ACM
#     Transactions on Mathematical Software 32: 113–137.
#
# Code comments such as "HZ, stage X" or "HZ, eqs Y" are with
# reference to a particular point in this paper.
#
# Several aspects of the following have also been incorporated:
#   W. W. Hager and H. Zhang (2012) The limited memory conjugate
#     gradient method.
#
# This paper will be denoted HZ2012 below.
#
# There are some modifications and/or extensions from what's in the
# paper (these may or may not be extensions of the cg_descent code
# that can be downloaded from Hager's site; his code has undergone
# numerous revisions since publication of the paper):
#
# cgdescent: the termination condition employs a "unit-correct"
#   expression rather than a condition on gradient
#   components---whether this is a good or bad idea will require
#   additional experience, but preliminary evidence seems to suggest
#   that it makes "reasonable" choices over a wider range of problem
#   types.
#
# linesearch: the Wolfe conditions are checked only after alpha is
#   generated either by quadratic interpolation or secant
#   interpolation, not when alpha is generated by bisection or
#   expansion. This increases the likelihood that alpha will be a
#   good approximation of the minimum.
#
# linesearch: In step I2, we multiply by psi2 only if the convexity
#   test failed, not if the function-value test failed. This
#   prevents one from going uphill further when you already know
#   you're already higher than the point at alpha=0.
#
# both: checks for Inf/NaN function values
#
# both: support maximum value of alpha (equivalently, c). This
#   facilitates using these routines for constrained minimization
#   when you can calculate the distance along the path to the
#   disallowed region. (When you can't easily calculate that
#   distance, it can still be handled by returning Inf/NaN for
#   exterior points. It's just more efficient if you know the
#   maximum, because you don't have to test values that won't
#   work.) The maximum should be specified as the largest value for
#   which a finite value will be returned.  See, e.g., limits_box
#   below.  The default value for alphamax is Inf. See alphamaxfunc
#   for cgdescent and alphamax for linesearch_hz.
