# Code comments such as "HZ, stage X" or "HZ, eqs Y" are with
# reference to a particular point in this paper.
#
# Several aspects of the following have also been incorporated:
#   W. W. Hager and H. Zhang (2013) The limited memory conjugate
#     gradient method.
#
# This paper will be denoted HZ2013 below.
#
#
# There are some modifications and/or extensions from what's in the
# paper (these may or may not be extensions of the cg_descent code
# that can be downloaded from Hager's site; his code has undergone
# numerous revisions since publication of the paper):
#
# cgdescent: the termination condition employs a "unit-correct"
#   expression rather than a condition on gradient
#   components---whether this is a good or bad idea will require
#   additional experience, but preliminary evidence seems to suggest
#   that it makes "reasonable" choices over a wider range of problem
#   types.
#
# both: checks for Inf/NaN function values
#
# both: support maximum value of alpha (equivalently, c). This
#   facilitates using these routines for constrained minimization
#   when you can calculate the distance along the path to the
#   disallowed region. (When you can't easily calculate that
#   distance, it can still be handled by returning Inf/NaN for
#   exterior points. It's just more efficient if you know the
#   maximum, because you don't have to test values that won't
#   work.) The maximum should be specified as the largest value for
#   which a finite value will be returned.  See, e.g., limits_box
#   below.  The default value for alphamax is Inf. See alphamaxfunc
#   for cgdescent and alphamax for linesearch_hz.

# Conjugate Gradient Descent
## Constructor
```julia
ConjugateGradient(; alphaguess = LineSearches.InitialHagerZhang(),
linesearch = LineSearches.HagerZhang(),
eta = 0.4,
P = nothing,
precondprep = (P, x) -> nothing,
manifold = Flat())
```
The strictly positive constant ``eta`` is used in determining
the next step direction, and the default here deviates from the one used in the
original paper (where it was ``0.01``). See more details in the original papers
referenced below.

## Description
The `ConjugateGradient` method implements Hager and Zhang (2006) and elements
from Hager and Zhang (2013). Notice, the default `linesearch` is `HagerZhang`
from LineSearches.jl. This line search is exactly the one proposed in Hager and
Zhang (2006).
